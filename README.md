# Gaze Experiment Data Collector

This project is a web-based data collection platform designed to gather gaze estimation training data. It uses a memory card matching game as the visual stimulus while simultaneously recording:

1. **Screen/game display** - What the user is looking at
2. **Webcam feed** - The user's face/eyes
3. **Click events with timestamps** - User interactions correlated with video timestamps

The collected data will be used to train machine learning models for gaze estimation, allowing the prediction of where a user is looking on screen based on their facial/eye features.
